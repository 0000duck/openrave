OpenRAVE Testing Proceedures
----------------------------

Setup
=====

using python nose for the testing framework:
http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose

Because it is not necessary to cater to the lowest common denominator, use easy_install to get latest test packages:

sudo apt-get install python-profiler graphviz
sudo easy_install nose coverage unittest-xml-reporting

Testing
=======

Running 'make test' in the root directory should run all tests and generate all statistics files. If the PARALLEL_JOBS environment variable is set to "-jX", then will distribute the computation onto X processes.

The tests are designed to output to Jenkins-friendly format. See the jenkins/README for more information.
