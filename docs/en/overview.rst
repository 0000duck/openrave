Overview
========

OpenRAVE includes a seamless integration of simulation, visualization, planning, scripting and control. The plugin architecture allows users to easily write custom controllers or extend functionality. Using OpenRAVE plugins, any planning algorithm, robot control, or sensing-based subsystem can be distributed and dynamically loaded at run-time; this distributed nature frees developers from struggling with monolithic code-bases. Users of OpenRAVE can concentrate on the development of planning and scripting aspects of a problem without having to explicitly manage the details of robot kinematics and dynamics, collision detection, world updates, and robot control. OpenRAVE provides a powerful `Python API`_ for scripting demos, which makes it simple to control and monitor the demo and environment state. There are also interfaces for Octave and Matlab.

OpenRAVE was founded by Rosen Diankov at the Quality of Life Technology Center in the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute. It was inspired from the RAVE simulator James Kuffner had started developing in 1995 and used for his experiments ever since. The OpenRAVE project was started in 2006 and is a complete rewrite of RAVE. The main goal with OpenRAVE is to create a planning architecture that would give robotics researchers an easy open-source interface to plan for their robots both in simulation and in the real-world.
