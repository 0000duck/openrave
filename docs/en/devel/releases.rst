Release Organization
====================

This page describes the OpenRAVE release organization and platform requirements. The :ref:`testing_framework` is responsible for auto-generating the releases and making them available to the general public.

All releases are compiled, signed, and uploaded using:

* email: openrave.testing@gmail.com
* sourceforge id: `openravetesting <https://sourceforge.net/users/openravetesting>`_
* launchpad id: `openrave <https://launchpad.net/~openrave>`_
* GPG id: OpenRAVE Testing (Testing and Releasing of OpenRAVE Packages) <openrave.testing@gmail.com>

Versioning
----------

Should allow multiple openrave versions to be installed simultaneously. This requires using suffixing several files and executables with $MAJOR.$MINOR similar to how python and `boost <https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/ImprovingPractices>`_ work.

OpenRAVE patch releases should always be binary compatible so that newer versions can read old plugins. In otherwords all 0.3.x releases should be binary compatible with each other. See `ABI Compatibility <http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0009.html>`_ for an excellent discussion. There is an `ABI compliance checker <http://ispras.linux-foundation.org/index.php/ABI_compliance_checker>`_ that can ensure this is so. For Linux systems, SO version is always the OpenRAVE $MAJOR.$MINOR version.

Windows Installer
-----------------

Official releases are uploaded on `Sourceforge <http://sourceforge.net/projects/openrave/files/>`.

Use `Nullsoft Scriptable Install System <http://nsis.sourceforge.net>`_ for generating an executable. Once the regular NSIS setup is run, install the `Large String Build <http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Special_Builds>`_. The NSI file is generated by running **release/generate_installer_windows.py** on the installation directory produced by cmake.

The installer:

* automatically installs python, boost, numpy, and sympy,
* unpacks the openrave files in a user-specified location,
* modifies **openrave/config.h** to point to the user-installed location,
* adds options to install Octave/Python bindings,
* registers the necessary DLLs and adds registry keys for OpenRAVE
 * Under **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\OpenRAVE** will be every OpenRAVE version that is installed. For example "|version|". Under that will be **InstallRoot**.
* and modifies the PYTHONPATH and Path environment variables.

Note that the provides DLLs are all compiled in Multithreaded DLL runtime.

Debian Source Packages
----------------------

Official release archive is: `ppa:openrave/release <https://launchpad.net/~openrave/+archive/release>`_

Testing archive holding the newest builds is: `ppa:openrave/testing <https://launchpad.net/~openrave/+archive/testing>`_

Debian source packages for Ubuntu/Debian can be prepared by calling cmake with::

  cmake -DOPT_BUILD_PACKAGES=ON ..

To upload the packges on the server do::

  make dput

It is possible to customize the PGP signer, the host to upload them, and what distributions to compile them for using::

  cmake -DOPT_BUILD_PACKAGES=ON -DCPACK_DEBIAN_DISTRIBUTION_RELEASES="lucid;maverick;natty" -DCPACK_PACKAGE_CONTACT="new signer" -DDPUT_HOST="ppa:new_signer/name" ..

Each package is separated into:

* openrave$V: all openrave related packages
* openrave$V-base: core libraries and tools
* openrave$V-data: basic scenes required for examples
* openrave$V-dev: development files and examples
* openrave$V-ikfast: Robot Kinematics Compiler
* openrave$V-octave: octave bindings
* openrave$V-plugin-X: individual plugins and their versions
* openrave$V-plugins-all: all plugins
* openrave$V-python: openravepy python bindings
* openrave-robots-extra: extra robot CAD model files

Sourceforge Releases
--------------------

Releases source code and windows installers.

Once a build is stable and all the release packages have been generated, they are uploaded to sourceforge using the **release/sendtosourceforge.sh** script:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../release/sendtosourceforge.sh
  :language: bash
