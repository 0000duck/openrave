Welcome to Open Robotics Automation Virtual Environment
=======================================================

OpenRAVE provides an environment for testing, developing, and deploying motion planning algorithms in real-world robotics applications. The main focus is on simulation and analysis of kinematic and geometric information related to motion planning. OpenRAVE's stand-alone nature allows is to be easily integrated into existing robotics systems. An important target application is industrial robotics automation. 

Getting Started
---------------

* `Installer Packages`_
* `Compile/Install From Sources`_

 * Latest stable source code (constantly updated):

::

  svn co https://openrave.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openrave/tags/latest_stable openrave

* `ChangeLog`_

* :ref:`getting_started`

 * :ref:`openravepy_beginning`, :ref:`command_line_tools`, `Writing Plugins in C++ <../coreapihtml/writing_plugins.html>`_, :ref:`environment_variables`, `Octave/MATLAB`_

* :ref:`overview`

 * `Architecture`_, `Interface Concepts`_, :ref:`package-databases`, :ref:`robots_overview`, :ref:`geometric_conventions`

Resources
---------

This document is automatically generated for every release and binds together the following versioned resources:

* `Core C++ API`_ - generated by doxygen
* :ref:`Python API <package-openravepy>` - generated by openravepy in-source comments
* :ref:`plugin_interfaces` - generated by the interface descriptions and their supported commands
* `Database Generators <databases.html>`_ - generated by openravepy in-source comments
* `Examples <examples.html>`_ - generated by openravepy in-source comments
* :ref:`robots` - generated by running the database generators on the :ref:`robots_repositories`

Other
~~~~~

* `Official Wiki`_ - latest news, projects using OpenRAVE, and how to link OpenRAVE with other systems. Users can freely add their own project information on it.

* :ref:`developers_guide` - for core OpenRAVE development

Licenses
--------

* The core C++ API is licenced under the `Lesser GPL <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html>`_, which allows the OpenRAVE developers to guarantee a consistent API while enabling commercial use.

* Most of the examples and scripts outside the core are licensed under `Apache License, Version 2.0 <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html>`_, which is much less restrictive (similar to BSD).
