  OpenRAVE provides an environment for testing, developing, and deploying motion planning algorithms in real-world robotics applications. The main focus is on simulation and analysis of kinematic and geometric information related to motion planning. OpenRAVE's stand-alone nature allows is to be easily integrated into existing robotics systems. An important target application is industrial robotics automation.

Licenses
--------

The core C++ API is licenced under the `Lesser GPL <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html>`_, which makes it possible for commercial use but allows us to maintain its quality and evolution. Most of the examples and scripts outside the core are licensed under `Apache License, Version 2.0 <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html>`_, which is much less restrictive (similar to BSD). Plugins can be released with any license the authors wish.
