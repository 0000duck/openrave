OpenRAVE - Open-source Robotics and Animation Virtual Environment (under the LGPL)

Read the wiki at http://openrave.programmingvision.com/ for installation for the required packages.

Linux/MacOSX
============

make
make install

This will install everything in ${CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/localinstall where CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR is the directory make is called in. To change the install path use

make prefix=/usr/local

On older cmake builds (version <= 2.4.3), the build could fail because libopenrave.so could not be found. There seems to be a possible issue with creating the symbolic link libopenrave.so in build/src. If this happens, create the symbolic link manually in that directory from build/src/libopenrave.so.X

Windows
=======

Make sure Visual Studio is installed.
Download cmake from http://www.cmake.org. When installing, make to click the option to put it in the environment path.

Run runcmake_win.bat, this will create a build folder with visual studio project files in it. Open openrave.sln and compile the Release configuration.

CMake Configure Options
=======================

The OpenRAVE build can be configured in several ways. When executing cmake (see Makefile for example), use these options:

QTCOINBUILD - Enable SoQt viewer (default is on). When disabled, OpenRAVE can compile without Coin3D and Qt libraries.
ENABLE_FFMPEG - Enable ffmpeg suite library (default is on)
PLUGINS - Build all the pluings (default is on)
DOUBLE_PRECISION - Use double precision (default is off)


Environment Variables
=====================

Before running openrave, some environment variables have to be set. These environment variables control where openrave looks for plugins and data files.

Setting up python:
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`openrave-config --prefix`/share/openrave/python

Example for linux bash use (can put it ~/.bashrc, directory separator is ':'):
export OPENRAVE_PLUGINS=/usr/local/share/openrave/plugins:/my/other/plugins/dir
export OPENRAVE_DATA=/usr/local/share/openrave:/my/other/data/dir

Example for windows (directory separator is ';'):
OPENRAVE_PLUGINS=C:\openrave\bin\plugins;C:\my\other\plugins\dir
OPENRAVE_DATA=C:\openrave\data;C:\my\other\data\dir

If any of the variables are not set, OpenRAVE will use the default installation directories.

Once everything is compiled, in the visual studio solution explorer build the project named INSTALL. This will install all files to c:\program files\openrave. Go to c:\program files\openrave\bin and run openrave
